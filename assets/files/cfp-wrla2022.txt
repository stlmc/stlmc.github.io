Abstract submission deadline: Dec 21, 2021 (AoE)

Notification: Feb 8, 2022
Conference: April 2-3, 2022

AIMS AND SCOPE

Rewriting is a natural model of computation and an expressive semantic
framework for concurrency, parallelism, communication, and interaction. 
It can be used for specifying a wide range of systems and languages in 
various application domains. It also has good properties as a metalogical 
framework for representing logics. Several successful languages based on 
rewriting (ASF+SDF, CafeOBJ, ELAN, Maude) have been designed and implemented. 
The aim of WRLA is to bring together researchers with a common interest in
rewriting and its applications, and to give them the opportunity to present
their recent work, discuss future research directions, and exchange ideas.

The topics of the workshop include, but are not limited to:

A. Foundations and models of rewriting and rewriting logic
 * termination, confluence, coherence, and complexity
 * unification, generalization, narrowing, and partial evaluation
 * constrained rewriting and symbolic algebra
 * graph rewriting, tree automata, and rewriting strategies
 * rewriting-based calculi and explicit substitutions
B. Rewriting as a logical and semantic framework
 * uses of rewriting as a logical framework, including deduction modulo
 * uses of rewriting as a semantic framework for programming languages
 * rewriting semantics of concurrency models and distributed systems
 * rewriting semantics of real-time, hybrid, and probabilistic systems
 * uses of rewriting for compilation and language transformation
C. Rewriting languages
 * rewriting-based declarative languages
 * type systems for rewriting
 * implementation techniques
 * tools supporting rewriting languages
D. Verification techniques
 * confluence, termination, coherence, and sufficient completeness 
 * temporal, modal, and reachability logics for rewrite theories
 * model checking techniques for rewrite theories
 * rewriting-based theorem proving 
 * rewriting-based constraint solving and satisfiability
 * rewriting-semantics-based verification and analysis of programs
E. Applications
 * applications in logic, mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology
 * security specification and verification
 * applications to distributed, network, mobile, and cloud computing
 * applications to cyber-physical and intelligent systems
 * applications to model-based software engineering
 * applications to engineering and planning.

PAPER SUBMISSION

We solicit submissions of regular papers, tool papers, and work-in-progress
papers. Regular papers must contain original contributions, be clearly
written, and include appropriate references and comparison with related
work. Tool papers have to present a new tool, a new tool component, or
novel extensions to an existing tool. Work-in-progress papers present
early-stage work or other types of innovative or thought-provoking work.

All submissions must be original, unpublished, and not submitted
simultaneously for publication elsewhere. Papers must be formatted
according to the guidelines for Springer LNCS papers and should not exceed
15 pages (excluding references). Paper submission is done via EasyChair at
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wrla2022. 

PUBLICATION

All accepted papers will be presented at the workshop and included in the
pre-proceedings, which will be available during the workshop. Following the
tradition of the last editions, regular, tool, and invited papers will be
published as a volume in Springer’s Lecture Notes in Computer Science
(LNCS) series to be distributed after the workshop.

The authors of a subset of accepted papers will be invited to submit
extended versions of their papers to a special issue of the Journal of
Logical and Algebraic Methods in Programming (JLAMP).

BEST PAPER AWARD

The program committee will consider a best paper award (a diploma and 500
euro) for a paper in which at least one author is a junior researcher (a
PhD student or the PhD defense was less than two years ago). The PC chair
may require the other authors to declare that at least 50% of the
contribution was made by the junior researcher.
