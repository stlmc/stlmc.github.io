#### Artifact

This page explains the SCP2024 artifact for our paper: "SMT-Based Model Checking for Signal Temporal Logic" by J. Lee, G. Yu, and K. Bae.

The artifact includes the followings:

* scripts to reproduce the experiments, and
* experimental results

*Remark: Our artifact can run **only** on Ubuntu because underlying reachability solvers (e.g., SpaceEx, Flow\*) do not provide MacOS executables.*


---


#### Installation

To install our artifact, follow the below instruction steps:

* Follow the instructions [https://stlmc.github.io/download/](https://stlmc.github.io/download/) to install STLmc.
* Download and unzip the artifact archive file (scp2024.zip).

#### Reproducing the Experiments

**Running the Experiments**

Our artifact contains the scripts to reproduce the experiments of our paper. You can run the experiments of the paper as follows:

* To run the <u>first experiment</u> of the paper. Go to the 'scripts' directory and use the following command:

  ~~~shell
  user@ubuntu:~/scp2024/scripts$ ./run-exp1 ../benchmarks/exp1 -t 3600
  ~~~

  This command reproduces the first experiment with the time out 3600s using the benchmarks in the directory '../benchmarks/exp1'

* To run the <u>second experiment</u> of the paper. Go to the 'scripts' directory and use the following command:

  ~~~shell
  user@ubuntu:~/scp2024/scripts$ ./run-exp2 ../benchmarks/exp2
  ~~~

  This command reproduces the second experiment using the benchmarks in the directory '../benchmarks/exp2'

*Remark: The reproduction scripts creates the 'log' directory and put the log files in it.*

**Generating the Reports**

You can create a spreadsheet report for each experiment from the log files using the following commands:

* To generate a report file for the first experiment. Use the following command:

  ~~~shell
  user@ubuntu:~/scp2024/scripts$ ./gen-report1 ./log
  ~~~

  This command generates the report file 'log-report-exp1.csv' for the first experiment in the same directory, using the log files in the 'log' directory.

* To generate a report file for the second experiment. Use the following command:

  ~~~shell
  user@ubuntu:~/scp2024/scripts$ ./gen-report2 ./log
  ~~~

  This command generates the report file 'log-report-exp2.csv' for the second experiment.

**Generating the HTML Tables**

You can create an html table for each report using the following commands:

* To generate an html table for the first experiment. Use the following command:

  ~~~shell
  user@ubuntu:~/scp2024/scripts$ ./gen-table1
  ~~~

  This command generates the html file 'table-exp1.html' for the first experiment in the same directory, using the report file 'log-report-exp1.csv' in the same directory.

* To generate an html table for the second experiment. Use the following command:

~~~shell
user@ubuntu:~/scp2024/scripts$ ./gen-report2 ./log
~~~

This command generates two html files 'table1-exp2.html' and for 'table2-exp2.html' the second experiment.

#### Experimental Results

You can also find the log files of the experiments of our paper, spreadsheet reports, and html tables in the 'logs' directory at the top directory. Note that all the log files, reports, and tables are generated by our scripts.
